# Fake News Detector

A state-of-the-art fake news detection API built with Flask and DistilBERT. This project uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to classify news articles as "Fake News" or "Real News". The model is hosted on Hugging Face, and the Flask API is deployed on Render.

## Overview

This project addresses the problem of detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It fine-tunes a pre-trained DistilBERT model on a dataset of fake and real news articles. The API exposes a `/predict` endpoint, which accepts a POST request with a news article and returns a prediction: `"Fake News"` or `"Real News"`.

## Features

- Fine-tuned DistilBERT model for fake news detection
- REST API built with Flask
- Model hosted on Hugging Face Hub
- Deployed on Render for public access
- Error analysis and logging integrated for model evaluation

## Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** – Web framework for building the API
- **Transformers** – Hugging Face library for DistilBERT
- **Torch** – For model inference
- **Git & Git LFS** – For version control and handling large model files
- **Render** – Cloud hosting platform
- **Hugging Face Hub** – Hosting the model files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Git installed
- Git LFS installed for handling large files (model files >100 MB)
- [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/) for hosting the model

### Setup Locally

1. **Clone the GitHub repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishna31102004/fakenewsdetector.git
   cd fakenewsdetector
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment (if needed):**

   Ensure your `app.py` is configured to load the model from Hugging Face:

   ```python
   model_path = "kb4086/fakenewsdetector"  # Hugging Face repository ID
   tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
   model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
   ```

## Usage

### Local Testing

To run the API locally:

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The API will start and listen on the port defined by the `PORT` environment variable (default is 5000 if not set).

2. **Test the `/predict` endpoint using curl:**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Breaking news: The President just announced new policies."}'
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```json
   {"prediction": "Fake News"}
   ```

### API Endpoints

- **`GET /`**  
  Returns a simple welcome message.

- **`POST /predict`**  
  Accepts a JSON payload with a `"text"` field and returns a prediction.

  **Request Example:**

  ```json
  {
    "text": "Your news article text here."
  }
  ```

  **Response Example:**

  ```json
  {
    "prediction": "Fake News"
  }
  ```

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Render. The Flask app is built using Gunicorn and is configured to bind to the port provided by the Render environment variable.

### Steps for Deployment on Render

1. **Push your code** (without the large model files) to your GitHub repo: `github.com/krishna31102004/fakenewsdetector`.

2. **Connect your GitHub repo** to Render and configure your Web Service:
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Root Directory:** (Leave blank if your code is in the root of the repo)

3. **Deploy** your service. Your live URL will be something like:
   ```
   https://fakenewsdetector-pg8i.onrender.com/
   ```
4. **Test the API** via curl or Postman as described in the Usage section.

## Results

The model achieved very high accuracy and F1 scores on the validation and test sets. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the logs. Misclassified examples were analyzed to further improve the model.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Analysis:** Use interpretability tools like LIME or SHAP.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs.
- **Data Augmentation:** Incorporate more diverse datasets to improve model generalization.
- **Additional API Endpoints:** Add batch prediction and a web UI using Streamlit or Gradio.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Integrate more robust monitoring for production deployments.
